# Medication Information Extraction System

## Description

This project is an AI-powered medication information extraction system. It leverages large language models (LLMs) alongside APIs from official sources like AEMPS to extract, organize, and retrieve detailed data about specific medications or a list of medications based on user queries. The system uses Pydantic models for strict schema validation and embeds medical documents for efficient vector-based search. It is designed to assist users in querying medication information efficiently without ambiguity, and supports both general and specific queries.
